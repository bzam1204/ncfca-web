Create Admin Club Management Page
</task>

<taskspec>
- Create a new page at `/src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/page.tsx`.
- This page will be a copy of the director's dashboard at `src/app/dashboard/club-management/page.tsx`.
- All related components from `src/app/dashboard/club-management/_components` must be copied to a new directory at `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/_components/`.
- The new page must be independent of the director's page to follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- The page will have three tabs: "Dashboard", "Membros", and "Solicitações". The "Training" tab must be removed.
- A new horizontal action bar component must be created and placed next to the `BackButton` on the new page.
- Data fetching logic must be adapted to use admin-specific hooks (e.g., `useAdminClubById`) instead of director-specific ones (e.g., `useMyClub`).

## Instructions

You are an experienced software developer AI. Your goal is to implement the <task>. **Follow these instructions carefully.**

## Context

The goal is to create a club management page for administrators. To ensure maintainability and adherence to SRP, this new page and its components will be a deep copy of the existing director's club management view, which will then be adapted for admin use.

**Source Files for Copying:**
- Page: `src/app/dashboard/club-management/page.tsx`
- Components: All files within `src/app/dashboard/club-management/_components/`

**Target Directories:**
- New Page: `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/page.tsx`
- New Components: `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/_components/`

## Critical

- **YOU MUST** create a new directory for the admin-specific components: `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/_components`.
- **YOU MUST** copy the content of the source files to the new target files exactly, before making adaptations.
- **YOU MUST** update all import paths in the new `page.tsx` to point to the new local `_components` directory.
- **YOU MUST** remove the "Treinamentos" (Training) tab from the `<Tabs>` component in the new `page.tsx`.
- **YOU MUST** create a new placeholder component for the action bar at `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/_components/action-bar.tsx`.
- **YOU MUST** integrate the new `action-bar.tsx` into the new `page.tsx`, placing it on the same line as the `BackButton`.
- **YOU MUST** review the new page and its components to replace director-focused hooks (like `useMyClub`) with their admin-specific counterparts (like `useAdminClubById`). The `clubId` parameter for these hooks should be extracted from the page's URL parameters.

## Step-by-Step Plan

1.  **Create Directory**: Execute a shell command to create the new components directory: `mkdir -p src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/_components`.
2.  **Read Source Files**: Read the content of the director's page and all its components.
3.  **Write New Files**:
    -   Create `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/page.tsx` with the content from its source file.
    -   Create each component file inside `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/_components/` with the content from its corresponding source file. The files to create are: `member-details.tsx`, `members-table.tsx`, `dashboard-charts.tsx`, `pending-request-details-dialog.tsx`, `pending-requests-table.tsx`, `reject-enrollment-dialog.tsx`, and `club-request-view.tsx`.
4.  **Adapt New Page**:
    -   Modify `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/page.tsx`.
    -   Change all component import paths to `./_components/...`.
    -   Delete the `<TabsTrigger value="training">` and `<TabsContent value="training">` elements.
    -   Create and import a new component `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/clubs/[clubId]/_components/action-bar.tsx`.
    -   Render the `<ActionBar />` component next to the `<BackButton />`.
    -   Replace data fetching logic to use admin hooks.

## Output

- A new, functional admin page for club management at `/admin/dashboard/clubs/{some-id}`.
- The page correctly displays the club's dashboard, members list, and pending requests in separate tabs.
- The page uses its own set of components, independent of the director's dashboard.
- The page layout includes an action bar next to the back button.
