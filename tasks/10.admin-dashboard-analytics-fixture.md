Fix and Enhance Admin Dashboard Analytics
</task>

<taskspec>
- In the "Operational Health" component, make each club name a link to its specific admin management page.
- Fix the "Growth Vectors" chart in `growth-chars.tsx`, which is currently processing data incorrectly.
- In the admin sidebars (`admin-nav.tsx`, `admin-mobile-sidebar.tsx`, `admin-sidebar.tsx`), add labels  navigation links pointing to the correct admin pages.
- For links where the target page is not yet implemented (e.g., enrollments), use a placeholder `href`.

## Instructions

You are an experienced software developer AI. Your goal is to implement the <task>. **Follow these instructions carefully.**

## Context

The admin dashboard requires several fixes and enhancements. A data processing bug is preventing the growth chart from displaying correctly. Additionally, several components and navigation elements need to be updated to provide direct links to the relevant admin management pages.

**Target Files for Modification:**
-   `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/_components/operational-health.tsx`
-   `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/_components/growth-chars.tsx`
-   `src/app/(admin)/_components/admin-nav.tsx`
-   `src/app/(admin)/_components/admin-mobile-sidebar.tsx`
-   `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/_components/admin-sidebar.tsx`

**Navigation Paths:**
-   Active Clubs: `/admin/dashboard/clubs`
-   Active Families / Pending Renewals: `/admin/dashboard/affiliations`
-   Active Members: `/admin/dashboard/users`
-   Pending Enrollments: `#` (Placeholder)

## Critical

-   **YOU MUST** carefully modify the files listed above.
-   **YOU MUST** use the `Link` component from `next/link` for all new navigation links.
-   **YOU MUST** correct the data handling logic in `growth-chars.tsx` as specified below. This is the most critical part of the task.
-   **YOU MUST** use the exact navigation paths provided in the `Context` section.

## Step-by-Step Plan

1.  **Fix Growth Chart (`growth-chars.tsx`)**:
    -   In `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/_components/growth-chars.tsx`, locate the `Promise.all` call.
    -   The destructuring of the results is incorrect. The order of variables must match the order of the function calls.
    -   Change this line:
        ```typescript
        const [affiliations, clubs, enrollments] = await Promise.all([
          getAffiliationsAction(),
          getEnrollmentsAction(),
          getClubsAction(),
        ]);
        ```
    -   To this:
        ```typescript
        const [affiliations, enrollments, clubs] = await Promise.all([
          getAffiliationsAction(),
          getEnrollmentsAction(),
          getClubsAction(),
        ]);
        ```
    -   No other change is needed in this file. The `processMonthlyData` function call is correct as it uses named parameters in an object.

2.  **Update Operational Health Component (`operational-health.tsx`)**:
    -   In `src/app/(admin)/admin/dashboard/_components/operational-health.tsx`, find where the club name is rendered within the list (`<p className="text-sm font-medium leading-none">{club.name}</p>`).
    -   Wrap this element (or the name itself) with a `<Link>` component.
    -   The `href` must be dynamic, pointing to the club's admin page: `href={\"/admin/dashboard/clubs/${club.id}\"}`.

3.  **Update Sidebar Navigation (All 3 files)**:
    -   For each sidebar file (`admin-nav.tsx`, `admin-mobile-sidebar.tsx`, `admin-sidebar.tsx`):
        -   Find the text labels for "Clubes ativos", "Famílias ativas", "Membros ativos", "Matrículas pendentes", and "Renovações pendentes".
        -   Wrap each label in a `<Link>` component.
        -   Use the paths from the `Context` section for the `href` attribute.
        -   Example for "Clubes ativos": `<Link href=\"/admin/dashboard/clubs\">Clubes ativos</Link>`.
        -   Use the placeholder `href=\"#\"` for "Matrículas pendentes".

## Output

- The "Growth Vectors" chart on the admin dashboard correctly renders the data.
- The "Operational Health" component contains direct links to each club's management page.
- All specified labels in the admin sidebars are now functional links pointing to the correct pages or placeholders.
